Features
------------
* **Complete privacy** - You don't need to use any personal information to create an account on a Selly instance, each user is given their own User ID along with a seed used for restoring their account.
* **Selfhostable** - No need to put trust on some 3rd party provider, you can host a Selly instance on your own server.
* **Simple and lightweight client** - Selly runs in the terminal, making it very memory and CPU efficient. And although it runs it the terminal, it's quite easy to use as it's got a simple interface and mouse support.
* **Easy to deploy** - Deploying your own instance is very easy, as there's a docker-compose.yml ready for you to use.
